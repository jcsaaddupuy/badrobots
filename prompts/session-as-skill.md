# Update Skill from Session Work

Review and understand the work you have done in the current session.
If the skill you where using was not sufficient, improve it with your new knowledge.

Pay attention to the problems you have solved or the task you have done.
Pay attention to extract the generic steps that can be reproduced in other contexts, and the specifics ones.


## Steps

1. **Review session work**
    - What problem was solved?
    - What tools/commands were used?
    - What patterns emerged?

2. **Extract knowledge**
    - Generic patterns (reusable anywhere)
    - Best practices and pitfalls

3. **Update existing**
    - New: distinct tool/topic
    - Update: enhances existing skill

4. **Structure the skill**
    - Core concept & why use it
    - Basic usage & common patterns
    - Quick reference
    - Cross-references to related skills

5. **Test & verify**
    - All examples work
    - Patterns are reproducible
